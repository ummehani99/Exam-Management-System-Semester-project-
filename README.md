C-based Exam Management System for Sindh Madressatul Islam University: manage students, marks, grades, and toppers
# Exam Management System

## Project Overview
This project is an *Exam Management System* developed using the *C programming language*.  
It is designed to manage student examination records in a structured and efficient manner.  
The system helps in storing, calculating, and displaying student academic data.

## Team Collaboration & Contribution
This project was completed through effective teamwork and coordination among all group members.

- *Umme Hani* and *Haram Shah* worked together on coding, logic implementation, and testing of the Exam Management System.
- *Haram Shah* also prepared and organized the README file for project documentation.
- *Namira Syed* contributed by preparing and managing the project documentation, organizing content, and reviewing the work.
- *Hafiz Muhammad Momin* supported the project through planning, coordination, reviewing, and managing printout and submission-related tasks.

Due to limited resources, not all team members had access to personal computers.  
However, the project was successfully completed through mutual support, idea sharing, and teamwork.

## Programming Concepts Used
In this project, several core concepts of *Programming Fundamentals* are applied:

- Arrays are used to store data of multiple students.
- Functions are used to divide the program into smaller and manageable modules.
- Loops are used to repeat operations such as entering marks and displaying records.
- Conditional statements (if-else) are used for decision making like grade calculation and topper selection.
- Constants (#define) are used to fix the number of students and subjects.

## Functionalities of the System
Using this Exam Management System, the user can:

- Add student records (roll number and name)
- Enter marks of five subjects for each student
- Automatically calculate percentage and grade
- View complete details of all students
- Display the topper based on the highest percentage
- Exit the system safely

## Execution Environment
This program is a *console-based application* and can be easily compiled and executed using *Dev-C++* or any other *C compiler-based application*.  
The code runs smoothly in Dev-C++, making it convenient for beginners to compile, run, and test the program.

## Learning Outcomes
This project helped us understand the practical implementation of programming fundamentals.  
It improved our logical thinking, problem-solving skills, and understanding of structured programming in C.

We are sincerely thankful to our instructor, *Miss Iqra*, for her guidance and continuous support throughout this project.
